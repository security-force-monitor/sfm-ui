<p>You will need a 64bit Linux machine with a C compiler installed and the <code>python-dev</code> package (python2.7), as well as the <code>curl</code> utility.</p>
<p>To install the kit, run</p>
<pre><code>cd ~
curl https://ffctn.com/a/ff-kit/install | sh</code></pre>
<p>then follow the instructions, which would lead to running</p>
<pre><code>source ~/FF-Kit/bin/env.sh</code></pre>
<p>If you type <code>sugar --help</code> and get a list of options, then it means that the kit is properly installed.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-application">Running the application</h2>
<p>Running the application and building it requires the development kit, <code>git</code> and <code>make</code> (as well as possibly other commands, but they should all standard or included in the kit).</p>
<pre><code>make run               # Runs the application on port 8000
make run PORT=8001     # Runs the application on port 8001
make dist              # Builds distribution files for the application</code></pre>
