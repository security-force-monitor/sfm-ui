<p>API ISSUES</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Country geometry doesn't line up with map.</p></li>
<li><p>this endpoint seems to have dissapeared? (not in documentation, server 404): https://sfm.datamade.us/api/countries/ng/autocomplete/geonames_id/ Its possible that its replaced with: https://sfm.datamade.us/api/countries/ng/autocomplete/osm/ But this new request requires a <code>q</code> parameter. NOTE: old heroku server also returns 404</p></li>
<li><p>This endpoint gives (server error 500) https://sfm.datamade.us/api/organizations/16/ NOTE: old heroku server also returns 500</p></li>
</ul>
